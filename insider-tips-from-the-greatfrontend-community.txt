in final rounds with apple, this is what recruiter explained There will be 4 x 45 min interviews conducted virtually so can be on 1 day or split over 2. See below for focus areas. JavaScript: Coding (similar to tech screen) Bug Hunt: Coding (working on existing code base) Web Performance (Domain knowledge questions focused on Web Performance) Product Thinking (Behavioral round focused on collaboration, balancing technical VS business needs and understanding user impact) if anyone has tips for how to practice / prepare for "bug hunt" and "product thinking" feel free to comment. i believe "web performance" will be deep JS trivia likely covering a range of concepts that are usually surfaced in FE system design interviews

they have a big question bank, usually team by team case yes they ask sys design, its a faang company so the bar is really high also one of the lowest paying of the faangs lol

Think it was 6 total rounds All fundamentals Vanilla js 5 yoe (In response to what do you think helped you prep for: big tech, specifically apple is asking a lot of vanilla js questions, dom related questions?) GreatFrontEnd UI questions all with vanilla js implementation

I finished up my Apple Phone Screen. They don’t like to ask LC questions but rather asked my background and experience with 10 mins left for a super easy js question. I guess the process really depends on the team you are about to interview for. They care more about if you are a good fit for the position rather than if you are someone who can ace a LC question. Hope I can make it to the onsite.

I haven’t interviewed but I applied and was preparing for it a while back. Similar to other companies Apple has started prioritising system design apart from the leetcode. For leetcoding they ask trees and sorting based questions. It depends a lot on team and level of position too.
