The interview loop typically assesses both technical and non-technical competencies based on Amazon's Leadership Principles.

Front end fundamentals round: Deep dive into JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM, browser APIs, event loop, accessibility, and performance. You might be asked to build a small UI component or debug code.
