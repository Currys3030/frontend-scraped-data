Front end fundamentals â€‹

Strong front end engineering fundamentals are essential. Be prepared for:

HTML: Semantic HTML, accessibility (ARIA attributes), HTML5 features. CSS: Layout (Flexbox, Grid), Box Model, specificity, inheritance, responsive design, animations, performance optimization. JavaScript: Core concepts: this , closures, prototypes, event loop, hoisting, var , let , const , scope. ES6+ features: Promises, async/await, arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest operators, Maps, Sets. DOM manipulation: Efficiently interacting with the DOM, event handling, event delegation. Browser APIs: Local Storage, Session Storage, Web Workers, Geolocation, etc. Performance: Debouncing, throttling, virtual DOM (if discussing frameworks), critical rendering path. Data structures & algorithms: Be comfortable with common data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching) and be able to implement them efficiently in JavaScript. Web performance: How to optimize page load times, rendering, and responsiveness. Accessibility (a11y): Understanding WAI-ARIA, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and how to build inclusive web experiences. Security: XSS, CSRF, CORS, secure coding practices for the front end. Front end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js): While the focus is often on vanilla JavaScript for coding, be prepared to discuss component lifecycle, state management, and performance optimizations within your chosen framework.
