They will paste a single line of comment or if your interviewer is generous enough they will give more context to the problem. Mostly for FEE interviews they expect you to (that means they want you to) write Vanilla JS because internally Amazon uses multiple frameworks/libraries so to test the basics they mandate candidates to write in Vanilla JS and also, yes it cannot be executed.

My phone interview had an array question which was pretty simple but it took me sometime to get it. Like Button, File Explorer and print this object of objects in the form of a HTML tree. They all started with the most basic part, very barebones implementation required. If time remains, they ask you to add more stuff to it. If you go through GreatFrontEnd's questions you should be more than ready for it imo.\n\n21st Sep 2024 :\n\nFinished my Amazon FEE I/new grad/entry level interviews. Waiting to hear back right now, but this is what I experienced: (Caveat: my interview was for a specific team, unlike a lot of general SDE/SWE new grad interviews I've asked about where it wasn't team-specific. I'm not too sure if this equally extends to FEE normally, but that's just what ended up happening.)

Behavioral : Topics mostly concentrated around the LPs of Customer Obsession, Learn and Be Curious, Ownership, and Earn Trust. Got a repeat question in one of my rounds, so I repeated one of the stories I used earlier because I don't have enough experience to have another story for that specific question 🥲. Technical : Received 2 implementation questions: Like Button and File Explorer, and 1 general-ish JS question (given a form, create a function that has parses the values in the form inputs and returns the form data as an object with nested properties). The implementation questions were basically the same/easier than GreatFrontEnd's version. The JS question is a tad reminiscent of GreatFrontEnd's \"get\" question + knowing how to get form values. IMO I flubbed this from getting caught off-guard from how it was described, followed by my brain suddenly forgetting how to program because of the emb"}

IMO I flubbed this from getting caught off-guard from how it was described, followed by my brain suddenly forgetting how to program because of the embarrassment/panic 🫠 Still, it was a very simple question overall that is probably fairly easy to solve. Additional Notes: Coding was in plain text editor/coderpad-style Allowed to choose any framework for the implementation q'ns Roughly 20-25min for behavioral, 30min for coding No bar raiser round. Amazon just recently announced in early August that they re-implemented this for entry-level/new grad after removing it sometime in 2022/2023, but apparently this change didn't get reflected in my specific process Result: Received the offer! 🥳\n\n20th Sep 2024 :\n\nhey everyone, I wanted to share my Amazon FE II onsite interviewing experience, thank you to everyone on this server and the GreatFrontEnd team Amazon FE II onsite: Behavioural: im sorry, i cant remember the questions i kinda went into aut"}
